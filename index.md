# A field guide to Land Use Inventory classifications

This page serves as the springboard for classification guidelines for
parcel-based Land Use Inventory work beginning in 2010. The guides that
this page links to will serve as living documents that will be
continually updated as questions arise regarding pecularities &
ambiguities in the classification scheme, and reconciling those classes
with the various parcel data sets we are working with.

**NOTE:** This field guide was developed for the first (2010) parcel-based
Inventory, but will be maintained and updated for future Inventory work.
For the 2015 and subsequent versions we are allowing for multiple uses and
flagging parcels that are on the cusp of being redeveloped. Be sure to
visit the [Coding Multiple Uses](./CodingMultipleUses.md) and
[Transitional/Redevelopment Parcels](./TransitionalRedevelopmentParcels.md)
pages for guidance on these topics.


## [Residential (1100 series)](./1100_Residential.md)

is a part of a residential development. This category excludes housing

housing is included within their associated land use as defined below.
Examples: military barracks are included as part of the military base
which is defined as Governmental Administration and Services; nursing
homes are included in Medical and Health Care Facilities; college
dormitories would appear in Educational Facilities.
